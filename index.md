## Welcome to Knowledge Graph Browser

Knowledge Graph Browser is a tool for visual exploration of knowledge graphs.
The users may discover different knowledge graphs through different views defined by various browsing configurations.
Real knowledge graphs are often too complex for human users and generic tools for knowledge graph visualisation and visual exploration are therefore quite hard to use.
The basic idea behind the Knowledge Graph Browser is to enable knowledge graph experts to configure a set of simpler views on knowledge graph nodes which can be then used by non-experts for browsing a knowledge graph from given points of view defined by the experts.
Anyone is free to create own configuration, publish it as Linked Open Data and let users to enjoy knowledge graph exploration.
